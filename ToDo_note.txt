Linux:
	Problems with text to speech
	Warnings in speech to text
	Issues with ffmpeg module 
		(This is the module which handles screen recording and frames extraction from mp4 file.)

Windows:
	No Code for Training
	Opens Application just like Siri/Google

	Training:
	Screen Recording (platform dependent tools
						linux - ffmpeg
						windows - ?
						mac - ?)
	Mouse and Keyboard Logs (python)
	Speech to Text (google speech API)
	Text to Speech (platform dependent tools 
						windows-cortana, 
						linux-festival, 
						mac-siri)

	Speech Recognition is slow
	- Need to work on Speech to text using streaming audio.
Code is all over the place
	- Not Modular
	- Hard to add more features
	- Complicated work flow
	- Restructure is necessary
